# module_3_challenge
First I created variables that contained all the possible characters the users may use;
Then I created a new function generatePassword;
Next I defined a variable with a prompt intructing the user to choose between 8 and 128 characters;
Then, in the case the user chose an invalid amount of characters, I made an alert to signal the user that their input was invalid;
Next I defined the rest of my variables along with the confirm command, each with their own indivudal string attached;
Then I made a series of if statements to attach to my variables on top of the js page;
Finally I made a 'for' statement to push the results and return a password.
